			<p class="p1 body">In our daily lives, we are bombarded by technology almost constantly. Flashing street lights, buzzing phones, zooming cars going... who knows where? It's hard not to feel overwhelmed with it all at times. Ever thought: <i>"If only I could escape the city life, just for a day."</i> Envisioned yourself in lush, green breezy fields with only the sound of birds and crickets around you? </p>
			<p class="p2 body"><b>Green spaces can give you that.</b> Though the concept isn't new, the act of creating green spaces is growing in popularity around the nation--and for good cause. Green spaces are areas of relatively undeveloped landscape. Green spaces can vary in size from the size of a baseball field to pieces of land several miles large... perhaps the most renown green space in America is New York's Central Park. In today's ever growing cityscape, they are absolutely essential because they help us relax, take a breath, and enjoy nature in an area unexpected.</p>

			<p class="p3 body">And why are they important? Green spaces benefits extend just beyond their visceral beauty. Scientifically, they have been known to improve overall health by reducing stress levels, depression, and other illnesses. In community spaces, they improve the quality of life overall. Environmentally, they are beneficial to the city space because they absorb carbon dioxide, effectively remove carbon dioxide from the air, and prevent excess soil erosion. Lastly, depending on where theyâ€™re located, green can reduce heating and cooling costs. <b>Lets create more green space!</b></p>
